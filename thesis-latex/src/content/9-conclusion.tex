\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

In this chapter I summarize my work and I introduce the future plans.

\section{Summary of my Work}
I achieved the followings:
\begin{itemize}
	\item wrote the new portal's functional specification,
	\item compared three JavaScript frameworks and chose one for implementation,
	\item created the front end system design based on the behavior of the chosen,
	\item created the database schema with JÃ³zsef Marton,
	\item created a high level system design with Bence Golda,
	\item designed the communication between the client and the server,
	\item implemented the front end student module,
	\item tested the student module with acceptance tests, and
	\item documented the deployment process.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
After this thesis I will continue to work on the front end modules and the system's design. Although I have created a database scheme and the system design, they are still in development. The front end modules will be implemented first, and then I will work more on the graphic design if the team is not satisfied with it. Because the project is still under development, it is possible, that the first official version, what is going to be used in the Software Laboratory 5 course from February 2016, will be different from the one presented in this thesis.
